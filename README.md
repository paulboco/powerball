# Powerball (Beta)

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/paulboco/powerball/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/paulboco/powerball/tree/master)

All Powerball drawings are available at the powerball.com website in a plain text file.
This file is updated shortly after each drawing which occurs at 10:59 PM on Wednesday and Saturday nights.

This package parses that text file into an array of Drawing objects.

## Installation

Require this package with composer:

```
composer require paulboco/powerball
```
